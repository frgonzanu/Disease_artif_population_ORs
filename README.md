# CCancer_population_ORs
This project aims to simulate an artificial population of individuals with characteristics defined based on statistics and scientific literature on risk factors associated with a specific disease. Each individual in the synthetic population is assigned a set of variables (such as age, sex, lifestyle habits, clinical markers, etc.) realistically distributed according to known epidemiological data.

Using these variables, a personalized probability of developing the disease is calculated for each individual, based on risk models derived from scientific studies. This allows for:
  - Exploring the impact of different risk factors at both individual and population levels.
  - Evaluating prevention or screening strategies based on risk profiles.
  - Generating synthetic data for training and validating predictive models in contexts where real data are scarce or sensitive.

The approach combines stochastic data generation with conditional logic and risk formulas extracted from scientific evidence, providing a controlled environment for exploratory analysis, simulations, or even educational purposes.
