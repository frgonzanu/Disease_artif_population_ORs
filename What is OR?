🔹 Odds Ratio (OR)
The odds ratio (OR) is a measure that compares the likelihood of an event (e.g., developing a disease) between two groups: the exposed (e.g., smokers) and the non-exposed.

An OR > 1 indicates increased risk in the exposed group.

An OR < 1 suggests a protective effect.


🔹 What is beta (β)?
Beta (β) is the coefficient in a logistic regression model. It quantifies how much the log-odds of the event (e.g., disease) changes with each unit change in a predictor variable (such as age, sex, exposure, etc.).


🔹 Relationship between OR and beta (β)
In logistic regression models, there's a direct relationship between the coefficient beta (β) and the odds ratio:

OR = e^(𝛽) <=> 𝛽 = ln(OR)

This means that β represents the effect of a variable on the logarithm of the odds of the event.

🔹 Use in building a probability equation
In biomedical models, beta coefficients are used to construct an equation that estimates the probability of an event (like developing a disease):

log(p/(1-p)) = 𝛽_0 + 𝛽_1 x X_1 + 𝛽_2 x X_2 ... + 𝛽_n x X_n
 
Solving for probability:

𝑝 = 1 / ( 1 + e^( 𝛽_0 + 𝛽_1 x X_1 + 𝛽_2 x X_2 ... + 𝛽_n x X_n )
 
This formula enables individual risk prediction based on personal characteristics such as habits, age, or genetics — highly useful in epidemiology, personalized medicine, and public health.
